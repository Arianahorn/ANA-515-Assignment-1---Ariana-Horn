```{r, include=FALSE}
#url for this data 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data/master/full_data.csv"

#rename dataset 
gun_deaths <- read.csv(url)

#new dataset fitler youth from gun_deaths by age <= 65
youth <- gun_deaths %>%
  filter(age <= 65)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#summary of the youth dataset
summary(youth)
```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
#code chunk to graph the distribution of the age variable from the youth dataset
# gun deaths by age 
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

```{r race-dist,echo=FALSE}
#code chunk to graph the distribution of youth by race 
# gun deaths by race 

youth %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Victim race")
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
